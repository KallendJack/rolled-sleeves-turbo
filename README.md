# Rolled Sleeves Turborepo

This is a Turborepo including Tailwind, ESlint, Prettier, TSConfig and Husky
Hooks. The purpose of using this monorepo is to remove the need to set this all
up for each client project as it shares the configs across all projects in an
easy to maintain way.

## Running Locally

1. Install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```
